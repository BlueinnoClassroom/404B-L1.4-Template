# 404B Lesson 1 Assignment 1B

## Pre-requisites

You must know how to:

- use `input()` to get user input.
- convert string to integer using `int()`
- use `print()` to print output
- create loop with `for` and `range`

>
## Instructions

### Split VS Code Window

You can drag `main.py` tab to the right side of the window to split the window into two panes. This will allow you to see the instructions and the code at the same time.

### Answering

You can answer the questions by writing your answers in the `main.py` file.

You can run the code by clicking the `Run` button on the top right corner of the editor.

The output will be shown in the `Terminal` tab at the bottom of the editor.

## Before You Start: ***Fibonacci Numbers***

The <u>**Fibonacci numbers**</u> are a sequence of integers in which the <u>first two elements are 1</u>, and each following element is the <u>sum of the two preceding elements</u>.

For example, the first 12 Fibonacci numbers are:

> 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34 55 89 144

## Your Task

Write a program that accepts an input of number (`n`), then produces `n` fibonacci number.
You may assume `n` is larger than 0.

Sample Input:
> 15

Sample Output:
> 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34 55 89 144 233 377 610
